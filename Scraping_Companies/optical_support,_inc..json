From conceptual design to manufacturing, we\u2019ve assisted companies in a wide range of industries from aerospace, defense and semiconductor to cinematography, biomedical and commercial sensing.\n\nWe use industry standard software tools such as Zemax, SolidWorks with Simulation and MasterCAM to design and analyze optical instruments and to export CAD models directly to CNC machine code. Our in-house CNC machine shop allows us to rapidly produce precision prototypes and move to volume manufacturing of finished products. When a project is complete, we can provide designs, documentation packages, and quality certifications for completed systems.\n\nOSI\u2019s expertise in precision optical instruments, prototyping and production, combined with our vertically integrated internal resources and facilities will allow you to meet your restrictive schedules while achieving ISO 9001/AS9100 certified quality standards.\n\nIf you have optical systems that need engineering and manufacturing resources to realize production, Optical Support can help.\n\n\ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8e \ud835\udc6c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7d \ud835\udc95\ud835\udc90 \ud835\udc73\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc70\ud835\udc79... \ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc85, \ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc85, \ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc85 \ud835\udc68\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc85 \ud835\udc95\ud835\udc90 \ud835\udc74\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc94!",
